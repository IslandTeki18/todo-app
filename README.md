# Simple TODO Application

This is a simple todo application. It uses ReactJS, Typescript, ParcelJS, Axios, and RecoilJS for the frontend. For the backend, it's using Supabase. The original point of this application was to test how easy it was to implement a Supabase backend. There will be features in here that will seem like overkill but it's all purely for testing Supabase's capabilities.

## Folder Structure

This repository follows the Bulletproof React Folder Structure. It's feature folder based folder structure with a global core components called the Atomic components that build feature components.

```
